This document describes how to quickly get started with the project to test its functionalities.

You can start using just Docker and Docker Compose, and later repeat the process using .NET Aspire.
Docker Compose allows to start without the need to install .NET, Python, Node.js, or any other tools.

# Start with Docker Compose

Make sure you installed Docker, including the CLI which includes the command `docker compose`.
To verify, open a terminal and type:

    docker compose version

which should return something like:

    Docker Compose version v2.32.4-desktop.1

Now enter the `infra/dev-with-docker` directory and run the following command:

    docker compose up -d

which should print something like:

    [+] Running 12/12
    ✔ Container dev-with-docker-qdrant-storage-1 Started 0.4s
    ✔ Container dev-with-docker-redis-commander-1 Started 0.3s

    ✔ Container dev-with-docker-extractor-1 Started 0.4s
    ✔ Container dev-with-docker-type-chat-1 Started

Skip to [Test the Wikipedia tool](#test-the-wikipedia-tool) to continue, or test
the .NET Aspire approach is you want to see how to run tools from source code.

# Start with .NET Aspire

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

For a more involved setup, refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

Before starting, check [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md) for tools and software required.

## Run the service locally

Before starting Aspire, make sure to build the system and all the resources. Open a terminal and
from the root of the project, build and then start the services, using the following commands:

    # Build all projects (.NET, Node.JS, Python)
    just build

    # Launch Aspire and all projects
    just start

The `build` script builds the Orchestrator and all the projects under the `tools` directory, which
contains .NET, Node.Js and Python projects.

The `start` script launches .NET Aspire host, from the `infra/dev-with-aspire` directory.
This will start the Aspire host, which will scan the `tools` directory for available tools, and
start each tool as a standalone web service (the services must have been built upfront).
Aspire host will also start a web service for the **Orchestrator**, and some Docker images including
Postgres, Qdrant and Redis.

The logs displayed on the screen provide a URL to access the Aspire dashboard.

![dotnet run](img/dotnet-run.png)

When launching `Aspire.AppHost` from an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, Rider, or Visual Studio,
the Aspire dashboard should open automatically in your browser. Otherwise check the terminal for
the dashboard URL (which looks like https://localhost:PORT/login?t=TOKEN).

The dashboard shows the list of services, their status, provides access to logs and metrics.

![Aspire Dashboard](img/aspire-dashboard.png)

From the dashboard you can access the logs of each service, for instance to check why a resource
might have stopped.

Please note that the Orchestrator is always running on port `60000` (60001 HTTPS), while other
resources use ports dynamically assigned each time the Aspire host starts.

**Unless you're debugging a specific tool, you should only send requests to the Orchestrator
on port `60000` (or 60001 HTTPS).**

# Test the Wikipedia tool

The Wikipedia tool is a simple web service that retrieves the content of a Wikipedia page.
It's used for testing purposes, such as providing content to process with other tools.

To proceed we need the port used by the Wikipedia service. When running docker images,
you can find the ports in use running the following command:

    docker ps

If you're using .NET Aspire, you can find the port in the dashboard.

Once you know the port update and execute the following command:

**Bash:**

```bash
PORT=55555
curl -X POST "http://localhost:${PORT}/en" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Moon"}'
```

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
$PORT = 55555
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:$PORT/en" -Method Post -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } -Body '{"title": "Moon"}'
```

The response should be a JSON object containing the content of the Wikipedia page for “Moon”,
including `title` and `content` fields.

> <details>
> <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

> Troubleshooting:
> - Verify that Aspire has started correctly and is running.
> - Check the Aspire dashboard to confirm that the Wikipedia service is active.
> - Ensure that the Wikipedia service is configured to use TCP port `5021` in the dashboard.

# Test the orchestration

**Using Just**

From the root of the repository, run:

    just test-orchestrator

**Bash:**

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:60000/api/jobs' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"_workflow":{"steps":[{"xin":"{title:'\''Trope'\''}","function":"wikipedia/en","xout":"state.content"}]}}'
```

(If you have `jq` installed, add `| jq` at the end to format the output)

**Powershell:**

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:60000/api/jobs" -Method Post `
    -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
    -Body ('{"_workflow":{"steps":[{"xin":"{ title: ''Trope''}","function":"wikipedia/en","xout":"state.content"}]}}') `
    | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

You should see a text from Wikipedia. 

Feel free to play with the content of `xout` transformation to see how the data is transformed using
JMESPath, e.g. try
- `"xout":"{ id: state.title }"`
- `"xout":"length(state.content)"`
- `"xout":"state"` 
- remove the `xout` field

# Chunking content

Let's use the orchestrator now to fetch some Spanish content from Wikipedia, chunk it, and show the first 3 chunks.
Note how we use "wikipedia/es" rather than "wikipedia/en", two separate "functions" defined inside the wikipedia tool.
See http://localhost:60000/ (web page) or http://localhost:60000/tools (raw JSON) for the list of available tools and functions.

For reference, here's the workflow. Note the embedding settings under `input`.

```json
{
  "_workflow": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "function": "wikipedia/es",
        "xin": "{ title: start.input.title }"
      },
      {
        "function": "chunker/chunk",
        "xin": "{ text: state.content, maxTokensPerChunk: start.input.chunkSize }",
        "xout": "state.chunks[:3]"
      }
    ]
  },
  "input": {
    "title": "unicornio",
    "chunkSize": 100
  }
}
```

**Bash:**

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:60000/api/jobs' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"_workflow":{"steps":[{"function":"wikipedia/es", "xin": "{title:start.input.title}"},{"function":"chunker/chunk","xin":"{ text: state.content, maxTokensPerChunk: start.input.chunkSize }","xout":"state.chunks[:3]"}]},"input":{"title":"unicornio","chunkSize":100}}'
```

(if you have `jq` installed, add `| jq` at the end to format the output)

**Powershell:**

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:60000/api/jobs" -Method Post `
    -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
    -Body ('{"_workflow":{"steps":[{"xin": "{title:start.input.title}","function":"wikipedia/es"},{"function":"chunker/chunk","xin":"{ text: state.content, maxTokensPerChunk: start.input.chunkSize }","xout":"state.chunks[:3]"}]},"input":{"title":"unicornio","chunkSize":100}}') `
    | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

Let's try using the YAML syntax.

**Bash:**

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:60000/api/jobs' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/yaml' \
  --data-binary @- <<'EOF'
_workflow:
  steps:
    - function: wikipedia/es
      xin: "{ title: start.input.title }"
    - function: chunker/chunk
      xin: "{ text: state.content, maxTokensPerChunk: start.input.chunkSize }"
      xout: "state.chunks[:3]"
input:
  title: unicornio
  chunkSize: 100
EOF
```

**Powershell:**

```powershell
$body = @"
_workflow:
  steps:
    - function: wikipedia/es
      xin: "{ title: start.input.title }"
    - function: chunker/chunk
      xin: "{ text: state.content, maxTokensPerChunk: start.input.chunkSize }"
      xout: "state.chunks[:3]"
input:
  title: unicornio
  chunkSize: 100
"@

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:60000/api/jobs" -Method Post -ContentType "text/yaml" -Body $body
```

You should see a JSON array with 3 chunks of text.

# Generate embeddings for a file

This is a more realistic scenario, taking in input a file, extracting the content, chunking the text,
and calculating the embeddings for each chunk.

Files can be uploaded by including their base64-encoded content in a JSON payload, or using the usual
multipart/form-data method. For brevity this example uses the base64-encoding approach.

## LLM configuration

Since the code requires an LLM to generate embeddings, you need some extra setup.

### Working with Docker images

Under the "infra" folder you can find multiple subfolders, with different stacks.
The `dev-with-aspire` folder contains is used to run tools from source code, and tools
are configured differently than when using Docker images. See the next section.

When working with Docker images, e.g. when working with these infras:

- `dev-with-docker`
- `rag-qdrant`

settings are stored in a `.env` file in each folder. To configure the LLM, edit
the `.env` file and set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable. 

When done run `docker compose up -d` to start the services.

### Working with .NET Aspire

1. Store OpenAI API key in `tools/EmbeddingGenerator/appsettings.Development.json` (key: `App.OpenAI.ApiKey`),
   and use an OpenAI model.
2. Define your Azure Open AI deployments in `tools/EmbeddingGenerator/appsettings.Development.json`,
   and use either an API key or Entra auth.
3. Pass AI endpoint and model details in the workflow, including auth settings. This approach works
   for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI using the `embedding-generator/custom` function rather than the
   default `embedding-generator` function.

This being a Quickstart, we will use the last option to skip configuration steps. However,
if you plan to develop workflows, you should edit `tools/EmbeddingGenerator/appsettings.Development.json`
and set up your models and credentials. This will allow us to keep workflows simple and free of
personal settings and credentials.

When done, build the projects and start .NET Aspire AppHost.

## Upload, extract, chunk, and generate embeddings

For reference, here's the workflow in JSON and YAML format. Note the embedding settings under `config`.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "embEndpoint":   "https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
    "embDeployment": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "embCustomDims": true,
    "chunkSize":     1000
  },
  
  "fileName": "example.docx",
  "content":  "...",
  
  "_workflow": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "function": "extractor/extract"
      },
      {
        "function": "chunker/chunk",
        "id":       "chunking", // This name is used below to reference the chunks generated in this step
        "xin":      "{ text: state.fullText, maxTokensPerChunk: start.config.chunkSize }",
        "xout":     "{ chunks: state.chunks }"
      },
      {
        "function": "embedding-generator/vectorize-custom",
        "xin":      "{ provider: 'azureai', endpoint: start.config.embEndpoint, modelId: start.config.embDeployment, inputs: chunking.out.chunks, supportsCustomDimensions: start.config.embCustomDims, dimensions: `5` }"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```yaml
config:
  embEndpoint:   https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
  embDeployment: text-embedding-3-small
  embCustomDims: True # This is a string, not a boolean, and it's transformed to bool inside the expression below
  chunkSize:     1000

fileName: example.docx
content:  ...

_workflow:
  steps:
    - function: extractor/extract
    - function: chunker/chunk
      id:       chunking # This name is used below to reference the chunks generated in this step
      xin: >
        {{
            text:              state.fullText, 
            maxTokensPerChunk: start.config.chunkSize
        }}
      xout: >
        {{
            chunks: state.chunks
        }}
    - function: embedding-generator/vectorize-custom
      xin: >
        {{
            provider:                 'azureai',
            endpoint:                 start.config.embEndpoint,
            modelId:                  start.config.embDeployment, 
            inputs:                   chunking.out.chunks,
            dimensions:               `5`,
            supportsCustomDimensions: contains(['true','True'], start.config.embCustomDims)
        }}
```

Adjust the **Azure variables** below and execute this command in Bash/Powershell or the equivalent Python/Node.JS code **from the examples folder**.

### Bash

```bash
ENDPOINT="https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
DEPLOYMENT="text-embedding-3-small"
CONTENT=`base64 -i examples/example.docx`

curl -X POST "http://localhost:60000/api/jobs" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"_workflow\":{\"steps\":[{\"function\":\"extractor/extract\"},{\"function\":\"chunker/chunk\",\"id\":\"chunking\",\"xin\":\"{ text: state.fullText, maxTokensPerChunk: start.config.chunkSize }\",\"xout\":\"{ chunks: state.chunks }\"},{\"function\":\"embedding-generator/vectorize-custom\",\"xin\":\"{ provider: 'azureai', endpoint: start.config.embEndpoint, modelId: start.config.embDeployment, inputs: chunking.out.chunks, supportsCustomDimensions: start.config.embCustomDims, dimensions: \`5\` }\"}]},\"config\":{\"chunkSize\":1000,\"embEndpoint\":\"$ENDPOINT\",\"embDeployment\":\"$DEPLOYMENT\",\"embCustomDims\":true},\"fileName\":\"example.docx\",\"content\":\"$CONTENT\"}"
```

### Python (remember to adjust the config):

Source code: [examples/quickstart.py](../examples/quickstart.py)

```python
AzureEmbeddingEndpoint = "https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
AzureEmbeddingDeployment = "text-embedding-3-small"

import json
import requests
import base64

with open("example.docx", "rb") as file:
    content_base64 = base64.b64encode(file.read()).decode("utf-8")

yaml_payload = f"""\
config:
  embEndpoint: {AzureEmbeddingEndpoint}
  embDeployment: {AzureEmbeddingDeployment}
  embCustomDims: True
  chunkSize: 1000

fileName: example.docx
content: {content_base64}

_workflow:
  steps:
    - function: extractor/extract
    - function: chunker/chunk
      id: chunking
      xin: >
        {{
            text: state.fullText, 
            maxTokensPerChunk: start.config.chunkSize
        }}
      xout: >
        {{
            chunks: state.chunks
        }}
    - function: embedding-generator/vectorize-custom
      xin: >
        {{
            provider: 'azureai',
            endpoint: start.config.embEndpoint,
            modelId:  start.config.embDeployment, 
            inputs:   chunking.out.chunks,
            supportsCustomDimensions: contains(['true','True'], start.config.embCustomDims),
            dimensions: `5`
        }}
"""

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/x-yaml"}
response = requests.post("http://localhost:60000/api/jobs", headers=headers, data=yaml_payload)

response_json = response.json()
print(json.dumps(response_json, indent=4))
```

Note: when using YAML, booleans must be handled carefully, to avoid JSON parsing errors.

### Node.JS  (remember to adjust the config):

Source code: [examples/quickstart.js](../examples/quickstart.js)

```javascript
const AzureEmbeddingEndpoint = "https://contoso.cognitiveservices.azure.com/";
const AzureEmbeddingDeployment = "text-embedding-3-small";

const fs = require("fs");

const filePath = "example.docx";
const apiUrl = "http://localhost:60000/api/jobs";

const contentBase64 = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "base64");

const json_payload = {
    config: {
        embEndpoint: AzureEmbeddingEndpoint,
        embDeployment: AzureEmbeddingDeployment,
        embCustomDims: true,
        chunkSize: 1000,
    },
    fileName: "example.docx",
    content: contentBase64,

    _workflow: {
        steps: [
            {function: "extractor/extract"},
            {
                function: "chunker/chunk",
                id: "chunking",
                xin: "{ text: state.fullText, maxTokensPerChunk: start.config.chunkSize }",
                xout: "{ chunks: state.chunks }",
            },
            {
                function: "embedding-generator/vectorize-custom",
                xin: `{
                provider: 'azureai',
                endpoint: start.config.embEndpoint,
                modelId: start.config.embDeployment,
                inputs: chunking.out.chunks,
                supportsCustomDimensions: start.config.embCustomDims, 
                dimensions: \`5\`
             }`,
            },
        ],
    },
};

fetch(apiUrl, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    body: JSON.stringify(json_payload),
})
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 4)))
    .catch((err) => console.error("Error:", err));
```

If everything works correctly, the service should return this output:

```json
